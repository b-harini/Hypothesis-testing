# Hypothesis-testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves the following steps:

Formulating Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (𝐻0): This is a statement of no effect or no difference. It is the hypothesis that the researcher seeks to test.
Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1): This is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the effect or difference the researcher expects to find.

Choosing a Significance Level (𝛼):The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Commonly used α values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.

Calculating the Test Statistic:The test statistic is a standardized value that is calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. Depending on the type of test, this can be a z-score, t-score, chi-square statistic, etc.

Determining the p-value:
The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
Making a Decision:

Compare the p-value with the significance level 
If p-value≤α: Reject the null hypothesis
If p-value>α: Fail to reject the null hypothesis 

Case Studies
In our analysis, we conducted hypothesis tests for three different case studies: pizza delivery time, milk volume, and the weight of widgets. Below are the summaries of each case study:

1. Pizza Delivery Time :
   Conclusion: There is no sufficient statistical evidence to prove that pizza delivery is not meeting the 30 minutes timeframe.
2. Milk Volume :
   Conclusion: There is sufficient statistical evidence to infer that the average volume of milk in cartons is not equal to 500ml.
3. Weight of Widgets
   Conclusion: There is no sufficient statistical evidence to say that the true mean weight of widgets produced by the new method is less than 20 grams.
These findings are crucial for maintaining product quality and operational efficiency.
